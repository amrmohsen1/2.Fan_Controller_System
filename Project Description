Fan Controller System:
The Project aims to control the speed of a temperature controlled fan using Atmega32 with frequency 1Mhz.
The Project is designed and implemented based on the layered architecture model as follows:
1. Application layer
2. HAL: LCD, LM35 Temperature Sensor, DC-Motor.
3. MCAL: GPIO , ADC , PWM.
